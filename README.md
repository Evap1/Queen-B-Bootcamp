In this project I built a server-client app using react and node.js which I've self studeid during the one week bootcamp at AppsFlyer & QueenB.
The project runs on local ports and I'm willing to study how tot upload the web-app to AWS. Menawhile you may watch a screenshot video I shot in the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBAQ0lSvQVM&ab_channel=EvaPoluliakhov

Feel free to give me comments to improve my code!
